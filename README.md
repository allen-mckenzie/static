## Becoming A Contributor
The process is simple! Join in the conversation! Become a character, write a character, and help define the story! 
1. Open an issue
	- Pick a section above
	- Specify the milestone
2. Create a branch from main
	- Add your contributions to a markdown file for your chosen section
3. Open a pull request
	- Discussions will take place within your Pull Request
	- Make adjustments using community feedback

Once an issue's PR is merged in it will become part of the overall work but that isn't the end of its life. Once a milestone is ready to be closed all of the issues for that milestone will become a revision so we can make sure the flow of that portion of the milestone is tracking with the overall concept and direction of the story.

## FAQ

### Q: Why An Open Source Novel?

A: It sounded like fun. Simple as that.

### Q: Will It Be Published?

A: Technically, its on the internet and in a public repository so... that's published right? Honestly, if this got picked up by a publisher my expectation is that all of the contributors would be given credit for their work. Who knows, if this is successful enough it might be the beginning of a new trend!

### Q: Can I Sponsor This Project?

A: Absolutely! Once we have the milestones established and the storyboards completed we can open up some sponsor slots and determine what those rewards will look like. Perhaps some live stream readings of completed sections, story development sessions, etc...
