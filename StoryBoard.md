**Prologue**

Scene: Bridge of a starship looking out to an empty horizon

Captain: How are we looking this morning?

Helmsman: Quiet so far. Should be ready for our next jump coordinate in the next hour or so.

Captain: Very good. Anything echoing out there?

Instrumentation: I am picking up something faint but I can't seem to isolate the frequency. As soon as I do it fades away and starts showing up in another end of the band.

Captain: Sounds interesting. Keep me posted on any developments there. Could be nothing but just in case.

[ faint sizzling sound starts but is barely noticeable ]

Captain: Can anyone else smell that? Smells faintly like one of the Ozone generators is leaking.

Engineering: Not seeing anything on the sensor arrays Captain but I can smell it to.

Instrumentation: Sir.

Helmsman: Sir.

Engineering: Sir.

Captain: What. Is that?

[ Horizon event. Faint crackling blue electric arcs begin to form in the distance. ]

Captain: **ALL CREW TO STATIONS!** I need a full report on the anomaly ahead yesterday. Helmsman, shutdown all propulsion and hold. Dead stop. Engineering, prepare all systems to alert status. Highest sensitivity. Intstrumentation, do you have anything on the anomaly yet.

Instrumentation: Sir, the event seems to coincide with the frequencies I detected earlier and with each arc it aligns to a portion of the fading band. I suspect this may be the opening of a worm hole jump gate.

Captain: Helmsman, adjust heading to 9-0 and get us below transition to the gate. Just in case. Everyone, prepare yourself for manuevers.

[ Silence grows as the arcing of the horizon event grow in intensity. The smell of ozone grows thicker in the starship. While the crew wait for whatever happens next we see the event grow in size until it is 4 times the size of the starship. Nearly the size of Earth's old moon. ]

Helmsman: Sir, I am unable to maintain our position. We are gravitating towards the event with and an increasing amount of speed.

Captain: Engineering, I need an assesment of options here. We need to divert non-essential systems to offline and increase the available resources to propulsion. What have you got in mind?

Engineering: Captain, I can reroute things now. Rerouting all systems other than life support, navigation, and instrumentation. We are at core systems only with a 150% increase to propulsion. Now.

[ The starship interior lights fade out to a dim red. The ventialtion systems wind down a quiet whine as the the propulsion system roars into overdrive and the ship begins to slow and backs away from the event ]

Helmsman: That did the trick but just barely. Manuevering us to get a better use of propulsion and gain some ground. Bearing 1-8-0, all ahead full.

[ Groaning sounds begin to echo throughout the starship as the ship attempts to pull itself away from the event. With no gain and no loss the ship is at a dead lock with the gravitational pull of the event. ]

Engineering: Captain, coolant systems are failing. We can't keep this up for much longer without risking a coolant purge cycle and swapping reserves. Under this load it might not make the swap in time before core shutdown.

Captain: Understood. Helmsman, what is your estimation to collision with the even under standard power?

Helmsman: I estimate collision at 15 minutes sir.

Captain: Engineering, how much time do you need for the purge cycle?

Engineering: Fastest I can do is 20 minutes.

Captain: Shave some time on that. Helmsman, prepare for a drop in available power to standard power on my mark. Engineering, get in place now and prepare of purge. Mark.

[ Loud thuds echo throughout the starship as the onboard systems whir back to life. The thrust of the ship cuts back down and the ship begins to slip backwards into the grasp of the event. The minutes slip silently by and the even grows closer and closer on the screens. The smell of ozone is thick in the air. Hair begins to stand on end and everything the crew touches causes small discharges of electricity and pain. ]

Helmsman: 2 minutes to impact

[ The starship groans under the increasing pressure from the event. It sounds like a submarine from stories told long ago. Steel complaining under the immense pressure of salt water filled oceans. ]

Helmsman: 45 seconds to impact

Captain: Engineering! Any time now would be great!! Everyone prepare for impact.

Engineering: [ Loud thud and the lights of the starship dim once more as the propulsion systems shudder to increased life with their new found strength ] Purge Complete! Captain, I was able to reroute some of instrumentations systems and shave off some load while keeping things up and running. That should help with the cooling issues but under this load I don't know how long that will be.

Captain: *sighs softly* Thank you engineering. Helmsman, are we making any progress here?

[ The event on the screens is still growing in size and it seems as though the starship continues to lose the fight against the event ]

Helmsman: I'm sorry sir but I don't think we will be avoiding this one. We are a the mercy of fate now.

Captain: Engineering, prepare to divert all systems to isolation. Maximum shields with life support and halting all remaining systems. Everyone, make your way to the bridge and stationary decks C and D. This is not a drill. Prepare for impact with an unknown event.

[ The crew aboard the starship scramble for the recovery stations and bridge. The sections of the ship at the center of the observation craft. ]

Captain: 5, 4, 3, 2 ... MARK!

[ The lights and electronics aboard the starship cut out in an instant. An ominous hum rushes throughout the core of the ship as the shield generators take on the brunt of the reserved power. The screens dim as they defer to their backup power. The next 30 seconds tick by so slowly it feels as though time has stood still. ]

[ The starship strikes the event and a blinding flash of blue white light erupts throughout the starship as the crew screams out in pain. And then nothing but darkness ]

**Earth Present Day**

Television sounds, radio chatter, phone calls. All communication bouncing from one piece of space debris to another. The future isn't quite what anyone expected but its functional. The people on earth are living yet another uneventful day when slowly one system at a time seems to start having issues, then ceases to function at all, until every aspect of communication stops functioning entirely. Cell phones drop their calls. Televisions show only static and blue screens. The global interconnected communications platforms cease to function and all online media and connectivity is lost. Panic begins to settle in as every country begins to consider the likelihood of being a victim of a cyber attack. People all over the globe begin to notice the darkening sky and the faint blue flicker of light above them. A shadow grows in the distance that throws the entire earth into darkness. The flickering lights grow in intensity as the event spits out the starship and the starship begins to slowly enter the atmosphere.
